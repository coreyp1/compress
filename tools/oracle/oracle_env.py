"""How a reference is spelled, so that no tool here spells one itself.

**Copied from `libs/font/tools/oracle/oracle_env.py`**, which copied it from
`libs/unicode`, which landed the pattern from `notes/suite/CONTAINERS.md`. What
is changed, and each of the three is forced by something about this library
rather than chosen:

  1. **The PROBE table names five references and they share one image.** The
     other libraries have an image per reference. Here one test binary consults
     three of them in a single run, and `/usr/bin/zstd` links `liblz4.so.1`, so
     the set cannot be split without an image whose pinned CLI does not run.

  2. **What runs inside is a compiled test binary, not a Python driver.** So
     `command()` grew `scratch` and `env`: the tree is mounted read-only and the
     tests write temporary files, so they need a writable directory and a
     `TMPDIR` pointing into it. `gcu_path_temp_dir()` reads that variable.

  3. **`check_pin()` runs in both modes**, as in `font` and for the same reason:
     the image named here is built here, so there is no digest to trust and the
     run-time check is the whole guarantee. On this machine that makes host mode
     fail rather than run - the host's pyzstd is 0.17.0 against a pinned 0.19.1
     - and that failure is the point of the exercise, not a gap in it.

Three properties, in the order they matter:

  1. **It does not fail open.** A missing image, a missing reference, a version
     that does not match its pin - each raises. "Skipped" printed where a
     comparison should be is the failure this directory exists to avoid, and it
     is the failure this library shipped for months: `pkg-config` could not see
     two of these five, and nothing anywhere recorded what version any of them
     was.

  2. **It says which instrument answered.** `provenance()` returns the line a
     gate prints beside its numbers. A clean round trip against zstd 1.5.7 is a
     different claim from one against some zstd.

  3. **Paths mean the same thing on both sides.** The repository is mounted at
     its own host path, so a path a caller built already resolves - including
     the `.local` prefix a test binary's RUNPATH names, which is why the mount
     is the workspace rather than this library.

Modes, from GHOTI_ORACLE_MODE:

  container  (default) run the reference in its pinned image
  host                 run this machine's own tools, and still check the pins

"""Run the oracle test binaries against pinned references, and count the skips.

    oracle_run.py <test-binary> [<test-binary>...]

**What this adds over `make test`.** The same binaries run in the ordinary suite
and pass there, against whatever the machine has. Here they run against the
versions `containers/IMAGES` names, and the gate is not only that they pass:

  **A skip is a failure in here.** On the host a skip means "this machine has no
  such reference", which is a fact about the machine. In a pinned image every
  reference is present by construction, so a skip means the binary could not
  reach something the image promises - and that reads identically to a green run
  in every summary line. `notes/suite/CONTAINERS.md` section 2.5 calls this
  failing closed; this is the same rule one layer in, where the thing that could
  fail open is a `GTEST_SKIP` rather than a shell `exit 0`.

  The library's own sentinels (`OracleIsActuallyAvailable`, one per reference)
  already fail when a reference is absent. This is the independent check on the
  same claim, and it is not redundant: a sentinel is code somebody remembered to
  write, and `test_lz4_spec_oracle.cpp` shipped one that answered for only one
  of its file's two references. Counting skips needs nobody to have remembered.

**Provenance, printed before the numbers.** Every pin is resolved and asked its
version *first*, so a run that gets as far as a test has already proved what
answered. That line is the difference between "the round trip passes" and "the
round trip passes against zstd 1.5.7".

Exit status is the verdict: nonzero if any binary fails, if any test skipped, or
if any reference could not be reached or did not match its pin.

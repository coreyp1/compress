/**
 * @file detect.c
 *
 * gcomp_detect(): which method wrote these bytes.
 *
 * ## What can and cannot be detected
 *
 * Three of the seven formats begin with a magic number, and those three can be
 * told apart from each other and from anything else with near certainty:
 *
 * | format | bytes | from |
 * | --- | --- | --- |
 * | gzip | `1f 8b 08` | RFC 1952 section 2.3.1 (ID1, ID2, CM) |
 * | zstd | `28 b5 2f fd` | RFC 8878 section 3.1.1, Magic_Number 0xFD2FB528 |
 * | lz4 | `04 22 4d 18` | LZ4 Frame Format, Magic Number 0x184D2204 |
 *
 * zlib has no magic number.  RFC 1950 section 2.2 gives it two header bytes
 * with enough structure to test: the compression method must be 8 (one byte
 * value in sixteen), the window must not exceed 32 KB (one in two), and the
 * pair must be a multiple of 31 (one in 31).  Together that is about one
 * random byte pair in 992 - better than the divisibility test alone would
 * give, and still a real rate rather than none.  zlib is therefore reported
 * last and only when nothing else matches, and the documentation says what
 * that answer is worth.
 *
 * deflate, LZW and RLE begin with data.  There is nothing to recognise, and a
 * guess would be worse than an answer of "not known": a caller who believes it
 * will hand the bytes to the wrong decoder.
 *
 * ## Skippable frames
 *
 * Both LZ4 and Zstandard define skippable frames on the same magic range,
 * `0x184D2A50` to `0x184D2A5F` (LZ4 Frame Format, "Skippable Frames"; RFC 8878
 * section 3.1.2), with the same layout.  A stream that starts with one cannot
 * be identified from its first frame by either specification, because the frame
 * belongs to both.
 *
 * So a skippable frame is not an answer.  It is stepped over - its size is in
 * its header - and the frame after it is examined instead.  A caller with only
 * the first few kilobytes gets ::GCOMP_ERR_LIMIT and the offset to read to,
 * rather than a coin toss.

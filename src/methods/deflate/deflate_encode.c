/**
 * @file deflate_encode.c
 *
 * Streaming DEFLATE (RFC 1951) encoder for the Ghoti.io Compress library.
 *
 * Implements multiple compression strategies based on level:
 * - Level 0: Stored blocks (no compression, data copied verbatim)
 * - Levels 1-3: Fixed Huffman codes with LZ77 (shorter hash chains)
 * - Levels 4-9: Dynamic Huffman codes with LZ77 (optimal code lengths from
 *   symbol frequency histograms, longer hash chains for better matching)
 *
 * The encoder maintains a sliding window for LZ77 back-references and uses
 * hash chains for efficient match finding. Dynamic Huffman blocks are built
 * by collecting symbol frequencies during LZ77 matching, then constructing
 * optimal length-limited (15-bit max) Huffman codes.
 *
 * See the "Dynamic Huffman Encoding" section below for algorithm details.

/**
 * @brief How hard one compression level searches.
 *
 * WHAT A LEVEL MEANS
 * ==================
 *
 * RFC 1951 says nothing about any of this.  It describes the stream, not how
 * to choose what goes in it, so a level is not a specified thing -- it is a
 * promise about how much work the encoder will spend, and the only way to set
 * one is to measure.
 *
 * Two numbers decide it:
 *
 * - `max_chain`: how many candidates the hash chain walk will consider.
 *
 * - `max_lazy`: hold a match shorter than this back one byte, to see whether
 *   the next position starts a longer one.  Levels 1 to 3 do not defer at all
 *   (see use_lazy in the caller), so for them this is read only when the lazy
 *   strategy is asked for by name -- which is a request for the effort, and
 *   gets the threshold the deferring levels use.  At the level-shaped value of
 *   4 it would mean "hold a match back only if it is exactly three bytes
 *   long", and a three-byte match is the one case where deferring cannot pay:
 *   the byte given up is a literal, the match that displaces it is four bytes
 *   at best, and the sequence it replaces would have been found at the next
 *   position anyway.
 *
 * NINE LEVELS THAT WERE FOUR
 * ==========================
 *
 * These used to be set by three range tests, and the ranges made levels into
 * aliases of each other.  Compressing 11 MB of source, manuals, XML and an ELF
 * binary at each level in turn:
 *
 * | Level | Size      | Against the level below |
 * |-------|-----------|-------------------------|
 * | 1     | 2,594,541 |                         |
 * | 2     | 2,594,541 | identical               |
 * | 3     | 2,594,541 | identical               |
 * | 4     | 2,351,738 | -9.36%                  |
 * | 5     | 2,351,738 | identical               |
 * | 6     | 2,351,738 | identical               |
 * | 7     | 2,318,112 | -1.43%                  |
 * | 8     | 2,318,112 | identical               |
 * | 9     | 2,315,952 | -0.09%                  |
 *
 * Byte for byte identical, not merely close.  Five of the nine levels did
 * nothing but round down to another level, and a caller asking for 8 got 7
 * while paying 8's reputation.  A table has one row per level because there
 * are nine levels.
 *
 * WHAT ZLIB HAS THAT IS NOT HERE
 * ==============================
 *
 * zlib's table carries two more numbers, and both were tried here:
 *
 * - `nice_length`: stop walking the chain once a match is this long.
 * - `good_length`: when the match already held is this long, walk a quarter
 *   as far.
 *
 * Neither does anything measurable in this encoder.  At level 6 with a chain
 * of 128, adding zlib's good_length moved the encode rate from 31.2 MB/s to
 * 31.5 and the output from 0.11% above zlib to 0.16%; adding its nice_length
 * moved it to 29.7 MB/s and 0.12%.  Both are inside the noise on speed and
 * slightly worse on size.  On the input where nice_length should bind hardest
 * -- runs, structured records and skewed bytes, where matches are long and
 * chains are deep -- cutting it from off to 128 to 64 left the rate at 1.4
 * MB/s throughout and cost bytes each time.
 *
 * The reason is the guard in deflate_find_match that stops the walk when the
 * chain stops going backwards through the stream.  That guard already ends
 * the average walk after about three candidates, so a knob whose job is to
 * end the walk early has nothing left to end.  They are not here because
 * carrying configuration that does not configure anything is how the last
 * dead setting went unnoticed for months.

//
// The optimal parse
// =================
//
// WHAT A PARSE IS CHOOSING
// ------------------------
//
// The match finder answers "what can I match here".  The parse answers the
// harder question: which of those matches to actually emit.  A match taken at
// one position blocks every match that starts inside it, so the stream that
// costs the fewest bits is often not the stream of longest matches.
//
// Everything above this is greedy, with a look-ahead of one byte (lazy
// matching).  That look-ahead cannot see what either choice costs three
// matches later, and no amount of deepening will make it.
//
// This replaces it with a shortest path search.  Think of the lookahead as a
// graph: one vertex per byte position, one edge for "write this byte as a
// literal", and one edge per (length, distance) pair for "emit this match".
// Give every edge the bits writing it would cost and the cheapest encoding is
// the shortest path across it.  Every edge goes forward and there are no
// cycles, so one sweep left to right settles it: when the sweep reaches a
// position, every edge into it has been relaxed and its cost is final.
//
// DEFLATE IS THE EASY CASE
// ------------------------
//
// The zstd parse in zstd_optimal.c has to approximate, because a sequence
// carries a literal length code: what a run of literals costs depends on how
// long the run is, so the cost of a path is not the sum of the costs of its
// edges.  DEFLATE has no such code.  Every literal is its own symbol in the
// same alphabet as the lengths (RFC 1951 section 3.2.5), and a match costs a
// length code, a distance code, and their extra bits, and nothing else.
//
// The cost is therefore exactly additive, and this sweep finds the true
// minimum for the prices it is given -- not an approximation of it.  What is
// approximate is only the prices, and they are approximate for a reason no
// parse can avoid: the Huffman codes are not built until the block is
// finished, and the block cannot be finished until the parse has chosen it.
//
// WHAT AN EDGE COSTS
// ------------------
//
// The entropy of the symbol under the statistics of what has been encoded
// recently -- a symbol that has been coming up often is cheap, one that has
// not is dear, which is what a Huffman code will charge for it.  Prices are
// in 256ths of a bit; see ../../core/bitcost.h.
//
// The extra bits after a length or distance code are priced exactly, because
// the format fixes them: they are written uncompressed, so their count is
// their cost (RFC 1951 section 3.2.5).  That is what lets the parse prefer a
// shorter match nearby to a longer one far away -- a distance over 24576
// carries thirteen raw bits, which is more than a literal byte usually
// costs.
//
// WHERE THE STATISTICS COME FROM
// ------------------------------
//
// Before anything has been encoded there is nothing to measure, so the model
// starts from the fixed Huffman code the format itself defines (RFC 1951
// section 3.2.6): eight bits for the common literals, nine for the rest,
// seven for the short length codes, five for every distance.  A count of
// 2^(15-len) prices each symbol at exactly the length that code gives it, so
// the first block is parsed as though it were going to be written with the
// fixed code -- which is the format's own guess at what a block looks like.
//
// From there the model counts what it emits as it emits it, and the prices
// are rebuilt at every sweep.  The counts are halved at the start of each
// block, which makes the model a moving average rather than a running total:
// the block being parsed counts fully, the one before it half as much, the
// one before that a quarter.

// Compression strategies
// ======================
//
// The `deflate.strategy` option controls how the encoder finds and encodes
// matches. Each strategy optimizes for different data characteristics:
//
// DEFLATE_STRATEGY_DEFAULT (strategy="default")
// ---------------------------------------------
// Standard LZ77 with hash-chain match finding, suitable for most data.
// - Uses hash chains to find repeated byte sequences in the sliding window
// - Chain length varies by compression level (4/32/128 at L1-3/L4-6/L7-9)
// - Levels 4 and up defer a match one byte to see whether the next position
//   starts a longer one; levels 1 to 3 take what they find.  This is where
//   zlib switches from deflate_fast to deflate_slow, and it is the same
//   trade: across a 19 MB corpus of source, prose, XML, binaries and images
//   it is worth 2.3% at level 6 and 2.6% at level 9, for about half the
//   encode throughput on text.
// - Chooses fixed or dynamic Huffman based on compression level
// - Good balance of speed and compression for general-purpose data
//
// DEFLATE_STRATEGY_LAZY (strategy="lazy")
// ---------------------------------------
// DEFAULT, with match deferral at every level instead of from level 4.
//
// Implementation differences from DEFAULT:
// - Defers a match at every level, including 1 to 3: a match is held back one
//   byte to see whether the next position starts a longer one, and the search
//   that position performs anyway is what settles it.  See
//   deflate_find_match()'s caller.
// - Uses the deferral threshold of the levels that defer, so that deferring
//   at levels 1 to 3 is worth doing.  See max_lazy in that caller.
// - Nothing else.  It searches exactly as hard as DEFAULT: same hash chain
//   lengths, same everything.
//
// Since DEFAULT defers from level 4 up, this is identical to DEFAULT at
// levels 4 to 9 and differs only at levels 1 to 3.  What it offers there is
// the fast levels' search effort with the slow levels' deferral: on 2 MB of
// filter-shaped bytes it reaches 22.428% against DEFAULT's 25.065%, and on
// 12 MB of source, prose, XML and binaries 25.954% against 26.680%, for about
// 10% of the encode throughput on general data and none of it on filter output.
//
// WHY IT IS NOT CALLED "FILTERED"
// -------------------------------
// It was, until the name was measured against what it does.  RFC 1951 has no
// notion of a strategy at all -- it defines the stream and leaves the encoder
// free, and nothing in a DEFLATE stream records which strategy produced it.
// "Filtered" is zlib's word, from Z_FILTERED, and zlib gives it a specific
// meaning:
//
//     The effect of Z_FILTERED is to force more Huffman coding and less
//     string matching; it is somewhat intermediate between
//     Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY and Z_HUFFMAN_ONLY.
//
// This strategy does the opposite: more string matching, at the cost of
// speed.  zlib's Z_FILTERED is faster than its default; this was slower than
// ours.  Borrowing the word and inverting the meaning is a worse trap than an
// unfamiliar name, because a caller who knows zlib would get the opposite of
// what they asked for -- and the other three names here (huffman_only, rle,
// fixed) do match zlib's meanings, so this one was the odd one out.
//
// zlib's actual rule was measured here and is not worth having: discarding
// matches shorter than six bytes costs 0.3% on filter-shaped data and 6.1%
// on general data.
//
// "Lazy" is the term of art for what this does -- zlib's own source calls the
// path deflate_slow and the threshold lazy_match -- so the name now says the
// mechanism rather than a use case it was never tuned for.
//
// It remains a good choice for PNG filter output, which is what the image
// library uses it for; it is simply not the only thing it is good for.
//
// It used to search four times as deep as DEFAULT as well - 16/128/256
// against 4/32/128 - on the reasoning that filter output hides longer
// patterns behind short chains.  Measured across 52 files of real PNG
// filtered rows, 7.3 MB, that is not where the win is:
//
//     chain   with deferral   without
//        32      31.22%       32.91%
//        64      31.13%       33.42%
//       128      31.13%       33.41%
//       256      31.12%       33.40%
//
// Chain length is worth 0.1 points across a factor of eight.  Deferral is
// worth 1.7.  So the chains came back down.
//
// DEFLATE_STRATEGY_HUFFMAN_ONLY (strategy="huffman_only")
// -------------------------------------------------------
// Skip LZ77 entirely; emit all input bytes as literals.
// - No hash table lookups or match searching
// - Only entropy encoding via Huffman codes
// - Extremely fast encoding, minimal compression
//
// Use cases:
// - Pre-compressed data (JPEG, PNG, ZIP contents) where LZ77 finds few matches
// - High-entropy data (random, encrypted) where searching is wasted effort
// - When encoding speed is more important than compression ratio
//
// Note: Even with huffman_only, the encoder builds optimal dynamic Huffman
// codes from literal byte frequencies (at levels 4+), providing some
// compression for non-uniform byte distributions.
//
// DEFLATE_STRATEGY_RLE (strategy="rle")
// ------------------------------------
// Run-length encoding: only find matches at distance 1.
// - No hash chains needed; just check if current byte equals previous byte
// - Very fast O(n) matching with no memory overhead
// - Good compression for data with long runs of repeated bytes
//
// Use cases:
// - Simple graphics (icons, diagrams) with solid color regions
// - Sparse data (arrays with many zeros)
// - Any data dominated by repeated byte patterns
//
// Implementation: At each position, scans forward while bytes match the
// immediately preceding byte, up to DEFLATE_MAX_MATCH_LENGTH (258).
//
// DEFLATE_STRATEGY_FIXED (strategy="fixed")
// ----------------------------------------
// Always use fixed Huffman tables, skip dynamic tree building.
// - Avoids the overhead of computing optimal Huffman codes
// - Avoids transmitting custom Huffman tree in block header
// - Faster encoding, slightly worse compression ratio
//
// Combines with any compression level:
// - Level 0 + fixed: stored blocks (fixed has no effect)
// - Level 1-9 + fixed: LZ77 matching at that level, but fixed Huffman output
//
// Useful when:
// - Encoding many small blocks where tree overhead dominates
// - Very speed-sensitive applications
// - Data that compresses similarly with fixed vs dynamic codes

  // Hash chain for LZ77 match finding
  // ==================================
  //
  // The encoder uses hash chains to efficiently find repeated byte sequences
  // in the sliding window. For each 3-byte sequence, a hash value is computed.
  // Positions with the same hash are linked together in a chain, allowing
  // quick traversal of potential match candidates.
  //
  // Data structures:
  // - hash_head[hash]: Buffer index of most recent position with this hash
  // - hash_prev[idx]:  Buffer index of previous position in same chain
  // - hash_pos[idx]:   Stream position when this entry was inserted (for
  //                    validity checking - entries older than window_size
  //                    bytes are stale)
  // - hash_at[idx]:    Hash value that was used when inserting at this buffer
  //                    index (for proactive invalidation - see below)
  //
  // HASH CHAIN INVALIDATION (Critical for correctness)
  // ---------------------------------------------------
  //
  // Because the sliding window is circular, buffer indices are reused when
  // the window wraps. This creates a subtle corruption problem:
  //
  // Consider buffer index 100:
  //   1. First use: hash("abc")=500 → hash_head[500]=100, hash_prev[100]=...
  //   2. Window wraps, index 100 now contains different data
  //   3. Second use: hash("xyz")=700 → hash_head[700]=100
  //
  // Problem: hash_head[500] still points to 100, but 100 is now in chain 700!
  // If we search chain 500, we'll follow hash_prev[100] into chain 700's
  // history, causing incorrect matches or infinite loops.
  //
  // Solution: Proactive invalidation using hash_at[]:
  //   - When inserting at buffer index idx with new hash:
  //     1. Check old_hash = hash_at[idx]
  //     2. If hash_head[old_hash] == idx (this index is head of old chain)
  //        AND old_hash != new_hash, set hash_head[old_hash] = NIL
  //     3. This ensures the old chain doesn't dangle into the wrong chain
  //
  // The check "old_hash != new_hash" is important: if we're re-inserting into
  // the same chain (same data at same position), we don't want to invalidate
  // the chain head, as that would corrupt hash_prev linkage.

 * ===========================================================================
 * LZ77 Match Finding with Hash Chain
 * ===========================================================================
 *
 * DEFLATE uses LZ77 compression: replace repeated byte sequences with
 * (length, distance) pairs that reference earlier occurrences.
 *
 * Data Structures
 * ---------------
 * - window[window_size]: Circular buffer holding recent input bytes.
 * - window_pos: Next write position (wraps at window_size).
 * - total_in: Total bytes ever written to window (monotonically increasing).
 * - lookahead: Bytes in window not yet encoded.
 *
 * Hash Chain
 * ----------
 * To find matches efficiently, we maintain a hash chain:
 *
 * - hash_head[HASH_SIZE]: For each hash value, the buffer index of the most
 *   recent position that hashed to that value.
 *
 * - hash_prev[window_size]: Linked list of previous positions with the same
 *   hash. hash_prev[i] points to the previous position that had the same
 *   3-byte hash as position i.
 *
 * - hash_pos[window_size]: Stream position when each buffer index was last
 *   inserted. This is CRITICAL for validity checking (see below).
 *
 * The Circular Buffer Problem
 * ---------------------------
 * The window is circular: after writing to index (window_size-1), we wrap
 * to index 0 and overwrite old data. This creates a subtle bug:
 *
 *   1. At stream position 100, we write byte 'A' to window[100].
 *   2. We insert hash chain entry: hash_head[h] = 100.
 *   3. Later, at stream position 32868 (= 32768 + 100), we write byte 'X'
 *      to window[100] (same index due to wrap).
 *   4. The old hash entry still says "look at index 100" but that now
 *      contains 'X', not 'A'!
 *
 * Solution: Stream Position Tracking
 * ----------------------------------
 * When inserting, we record hash_pos[idx] = stream_pos (the true position).
 * When matching, we check:
 *
 *   stream_dist = current_stream_pos - hash_pos[match_idx]
 *   buf_dist = (current_buf_idx - match_idx + window_size) % window_size
 *
 *   if (stream_dist != buf_dist):
 *       The entry is stale (buffer wrapped) - skip it
 *
 * This ensures we only use matches that are actually valid in the current
 * window contents.
 *
 * ===========================================================================

 *
 * ## Proactive Hash Chain Invalidation
 *
 * This function implements proactive invalidation to prevent hash chain
 * corruption when buffer indices are reused. The problem and solution:
 *
 * **Problem**: When the circular window buffer wraps, a buffer index that
 * was previously part of hash chain A may be reused for data that hashes
 * to chain B. If hash_head[A] still points to this index, searches on
 * chain A will incorrectly follow hash_prev into chain B's history.
 *
 * **Solution**: Before inserting at index `idx` with hash `new_hash`:
 * 1. Look up `old_hash = hash_at[idx]` (the hash from the previous insert)
 * 2. If `hash_head[old_hash] == idx` AND `old_hash != new_hash`:
 *    - This index is still the head of the old chain
 *    - Set `hash_head[old_hash] = hash_prev[idx]`, which unlinks this index
 *      from the old chain and leaves the rest of it intact
 * 3. The condition `old_hash != new_hash` is critical: if we're reinserting
 *    into the same chain, invalidating would corrupt hash_prev linkage.
 *
 * This proactive approach ensures hash chains are always clean, avoiding
 * the need for expensive validation during match searches.

/**
 * @brief Lay a preset dictionary down as the history the stream starts from.
 *
 * RFC 1951 has no notion of a dictionary, and that is what makes this simple:
 * the bytes are history.  They go into the window and into the hash chains by
 * the same route input takes, and then the encoder starts on the real input
 * with the window already full.  Nothing is emitted for them.
 *
 * Only the last @c window_size bytes are laid down, because a distance cannot
 * exceed the window and anything further back could never be referenced.  zlib's
 * @c deflateSetDictionary keeps the same tail.
 *
 * Two details that are easy to get wrong:
 *
 * - Only positions with three whole dictionary bytes ahead of them are
 *   indexed.  The hash reads three bytes and wraps at the window's end, so
 *   indexing the last two would hash dictionary bytes together with whatever
 *   the window holds at position zero.
 * - deflate_insert_hash() refuses to insert while the lookahead is under
 *   three bytes, which is right for input and wrong here: the dictionary is
 *   not lookahead, there is simply a lot of it.  It is lent the length for the
 *   duration and given back zero, because none of these bytes is waiting to be
 *   encoded.

 * ===========================================================================
 * Dynamic Huffman Encoding (RFC 1951 Section 3.2.7)
 * ===========================================================================
 *
 * OVERVIEW
 * --------
 * For compression levels 4-9, we build optimal Huffman codes based on actual
 * symbol frequencies observed in the data. Dynamic Huffman typically achieves
 * better compression than fixed Huffman because the code lengths are tailored
 * to the specific input data's statistical properties.
 *
 * ALGORITHM STEPS
 * ---------------
 * 1. FREQUENCY COLLECTION (during LZ77 matching in encoder_update):
 *    - lit_freq[0..255]: Count of each literal byte
 *    - lit_freq[257..285]: Count of each length code (match lengths 3-258)
 *    - dist_freq[0..29]: Count of each distance code (distances 1-32768)
 *    - lit_freq[256] is incremented for the end-of-block marker
 *
 * 2. CODE LENGTH CONSTRUCTION (build_code_lengths):
 *    - Hand the frequencies to the shared package-merge implementation in
 *      src/core/huffman_lengths.c
 *    - It returns the code lengths that encode these frequencies in the
 *      fewest bits of any code whose longest code word fits the cap - 15 bits
 *      for the literal/length and distance alphabets, 7 for the code-length
 *      alphabet - and that always describe a complete code
 *
 * 3. (no separate limiting step)
 *    - The cap is part of what package-merge solves, so there is no clamp to
 *      repair afterwards.  Deciding the cap and the code separately is what
 *      this encoder used to do, and it cost bits: a clamp cannot see which
 *      lengthening elsewhere is cheapest, so it spent the code space in the
 *      wrong place
 *
 * 4. CODE LENGTH ENCODING (RFC 1951 Section 3.2.7):
 *    - Combine literal/length and distance code lengths into one sequence
 *    - Run-length encode using the code-length alphabet:
 *      * 0-15: Literal code length values
 *      * 16: Copy previous code length 3-6 times (2 extra bits)
 *      * 17: Repeat code length 0 for 3-10 times (3 extra bits)
 *      * 18: Repeat code length 0 for 11-138 times (7 extra bits)
 *    - Build a Huffman tree for the code-length symbols themselves
 *
 * 5. BLOCK HEADER WRITING:
 *    - BFINAL (1 bit): 1 if this is the final block
 *    - BTYPE (2 bits): 10 binary = dynamic Huffman
 *    - HLIT (5 bits): Number of literal/length codes - 257 (range 0-29)
 *    - HDIST (5 bits): Number of distance codes - 1 (range 0-29)
 *    - HCLEN (4 bits): Number of code-length codes - 4 (range 0-15)
 *    - Code-length code lengths (3 bits each, in permuted order k_cl_order)
 *    - Encoded code lengths for literal/length alphabet
 *    - Encoded code lengths for distance alphabet
 *
 * 6. DATA ENCODING:
 *    - Emit each buffered symbol using its dynamic Huffman code
 *    - End with end-of-block symbol (256)
 *
 * DESIGN RATIONALE
 * ----------------
 * - Package-merge is O(n * max_bits) and is exact under the cap; the 15-bit
 *   limit is mandated by RFC 1951 section 3.2.7
 * - Fallback to fixed Huffman occurs on memory allocation failure
 * - Empty distance trees are valid when no LZ77 matches are used (e.g.,
 *   incompressible data or very short inputs)
 *
 * MEMORY LAYOUT
 * -------------
 * - lit_freq: 288 uint32_t entries (allocated for levels > 3)
 * - dist_freq: 32 uint32_t entries (allocated for levels > 3)
 * - Temporary allocations in build_code_lengths: 2 * used * max_bits chain
 *   records, where `used` counts the symbols that actually occur
 *
 * ===========================================================================

/**
 * @brief Write a complete dynamic Huffman block.
 *
 * This function performs the following steps:
 * 1. Builds optimal code lengths from the frequency histograms
 * 2. Calculates HLIT, HDIST (number of codes to transmit)
 * 3. Run-length encodes the code lengths using symbols 16, 17, 18
 * 4. Builds a Huffman tree for the code-length alphabet
 * 5. Writes the complete block header (BFINAL, BTYPE, HLIT, HDIST, HCLEN)
 * 6. Writes the code-length code lengths in permuted order
 * 7. Writes the encoded literal/length and distance code lengths
 * 8. Writes all buffered symbols using the dynamic Huffman codes
 * 9. Writes the end-of-block symbol (256)
 *
 * Falls back to fixed Huffman on memory allocation failure or if no
 * frequency data is available.
 *
 * @param st    Encoder state with frequency histograms and symbol buffer
 * @param final Non-zero if this is the final block (sets BFINAL bit)
 * @return GCOMP_OK on success, error code on failure

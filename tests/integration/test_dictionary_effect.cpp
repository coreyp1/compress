/**
 * @file test_dictionary_effect.cpp
 *
 * A dictionary that is accepted but not used looks exactly like one that
 * works: the stream round-trips either way, the dictionary ID is written, and
 * every existing test passes. The only thing that tells the two apart is
 * whether the output actually gets smaller.
 *
 * So this measures. The case is the strongest one there is - the payload is
 * the dictionary, byte for byte - where a working dictionary turns the whole
 * input into one long match and a few bytes of framing. The reference
 * implementation puts 4096 such bytes in 21 bytes; anything in the hundreds
 * means the dictionary content is not reaching the match finder.
 *
 * ## What this found, and what was done about it
 *
 * The mechanism was sound for content whose four-byte prefixes are mostly
 * distinct - a dictionary worked at every level there, taking 4096 bytes to
 * 18 - and useless at the low levels on data with very few distinct prefixes.
 * With a twelve-word vocabulary, 4091 bytes measured 739 at level 1 and 655 at
 * level 3, the default, against 17 from level 6 up.
 *
 * That was the chain running out of attempts rather than the dictionary
 * failing to load. The chain is walked newest-first for at most `search_depth`
 * candidates - four at level 1, sixteen at level 3 - and where thousands of
 * positions share a hash, every one of those is recent and none is in the
 * dictionary.
 *
 * The dictionary now has a search budget of its own and a way into its part of
 * the chain that does not run through the recent part first
 * (`zstd_mf_note_dictionary`, and ZSTD_MF_DICT_MIN_DEPTH in
 * zstd_matchfinder.c). On that same twelve-word input every level from 1 to 19
 * now reaches 17 bytes.
 *
 * Worth recording, because it was measured rather than assumed: libzstd is
 * erratic on this shape. On the identical dictionary and payload it produces
 * 810 bytes at level 1, 810 at level 2, 21 at level 3, 661 at level 4 - worse
 * than level 3 - 345 at level 5, and 23 at level 6. An earlier version of this
 * comment said libzstd handled these levels properly and we did not; that was
 * wrong, and the measurement is above.

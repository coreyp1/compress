 *
 * Allocator abstraction for the Ghoti.io Compress library.
 *
 * This is cutil's @ref GCU_Allocator under a local name. The two were
 * identical - same four function pointers, same context argument, same
 * semantics - and having one definition means an allocator written for any
 * library in the suite works with all of them, rather than needing a
 * near-identical copy per library.
 *
 * Existing code needs no change: `gcomp_allocator_t` still names the type and
 * gcomp_allocator_default() still returns the stdlib-backed instance.

 * from the struct as its first argument.

 * Two requirements beyond the C library equivalents: `calloc_fn` must treat
 * overflow of `nitems * size` as an allocation failure and return NULL rather
 * than allocating a truncated block, and a zero-size request should return a
 * usable non-NULL pointer, so that NULL always means failure.

 * An output buffer of at least this size is always enough: encoding

 * large cannot fail for want of room, whatever those bytes turn out to be.
 * Data that does not compress is the case that matters - every method here
 * falls back to storing such data verbatim, and the bound is what that costs,
 * which is the input plus the framing around it.
 *
 * Use it to size a buffer before a one-shot encode:
 *
 * @code
 * size_t cap = 0;
 * if (gcomp_encode_bound(NULL, "zstd", opts, len, &cap) != GCOMP_OK) { ... }

 * @endcode
 *
 * ## What it does not cover
 *
 * One whole stream: create, update as often as you like, finish. It does
 * **not** account for gcomp_encoder_flush(). A flush ends a block early and
 * pads to a byte boundary, so it adds output every time it is called and the
 * total depends on how often a caller chooses to call it - which is not
 * knowable from the input size. A caller that flushes must size its own
 * buffer, or stream into one it can refill.
 *
 * The options matter and are read: a gzip name and comment, an LZ4 block size
 * and its checksums, a zstd window that lowers the maximum block size all move
 * the answer. Pass the same options you will pass to the encoder.
 *
 * @param registry The registry to use (can be NULL to use default registry)
 * @param method_name The name of the compression method (e.g., "deflate")

 * @brief Work out which method wrote these bytes

 * Recognises the three formats that carry a magic number - gzip (RFC 1952
 * section 2.3.1), Zstandard (RFC 8878 section 3.1.1) and LZ4 (LZ4 Frame
 * Format) - with near certainty, because four bytes of magic do not occur by
 * accident.
 *
 * zlib is different and the difference matters. RFC 1950 gives it no magic
 * number, only two header bytes with enough structure to test - a compression
 * method of 8, a window of at most 32 KB, and a value divisible by 31 - which
 * about one random byte pair in 992 satisfies. zlib is therefore reported only
 * when nothing else matches, and a caller that cannot afford a wrong answer
 * should treat it as a hint and confirm by decoding.
 *
 * deflate, LZW and RLE begin with data. They are never reported, and a stream
 * in one of them comes back as ::GCOMP_ERR_UNSUPPORTED - which is the honest
 * answer, and better than a guess the caller would act on.
 *
 * A stream that opens with skippable frames is stepped over until a frame that
 * identifies itself is reached, because LZ4 and Zstandard share that magic
 * range and a skippable frame belongs to both.
 *
 * There is no registry parameter: which format wrote a stream is a property of
 * the bytes, not of what happens to be registered. Check the name against a
 * registry yourself if that matters.

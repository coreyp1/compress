# The optimization level is the one thing that should distinguish the two
# builds' compile flags, and until now it did not: the BUILD=debug block above
# renamed the artifact and changed nothing about how the code was compiled, so
# `make BUILD=debug` produced -O3 objects carrying a -debug filename - a debug
# build that cannot be stepped through. -g stays in both, because a release
# build nobody can read in a debugger is a release build nobody can diagnose,
# and the symbols cost only file size.
#
# -O3 is retained for release, and as of 2026-09-23 it is measured rather than
# inherited. One encode per case over a fixed 256 KB input, deterministic
# counters because the machine was far too loaded for a clock (a 12-round
# alternating wall-clock sweep put the reference library's own rate 8.3% apart
# between runs, which is more than the effect being looked for):
#
#   instructions, -O3 vs -O2   deflate-9 -9.80%   zstd-9 -10.80%
#                              zstd-16   -4.37%   median over 9 cases -1.35%
#                              cheap cases within 0.1% either way
#   data refs                  deflate-9 -9.80%   zstd-9 -16.94%  zstd-16 -7.61%
#   D1 misses                  -0.06% .. +0.01%   LLd misses +0.00% .. +0.01%
#   incompressible input       deflate-9 -1.92%   zstd-9 -11.31% (instructions)
#
# So -O3 is not buying instructions with cache misses, which is the way this
# question usually goes wrong: it does strictly less work on every axis. The
# miss counts are flat because the working set belongs to the algorithm and the
# tables, which the optimizer does not change; what it removes is loads and
# stores. Compressed output is byte-identical at both levels.
#
# What appends its own -O after this one, all relying on the last -O winning:
# `make coverage` passes EXTRA_CFLAGS="--coverage -O0", which lands at the end
# of CFLAGS below. What does NOT: AFL_CFLAGS is built standalone with its own
# -O2 and never sees CFLAGS.
#
# ASAN_UBSAN_FLAGS carries no -O at all, so the sanitizer build inherits
# whatever this says. That was not a decision anyone recorded - it is what
# happens when the flag set omits an -O - so measure it rather than assume:
#
#   make -n test-asan PREFIX=... | grep -e ' -c ' | grep -oE -e '-O[0-3s]' \
#     | sort | uniq -c
#
# gives 76 C library TUs at -O3 and 113 C++ test TUs at -O1 (a literal in
# CXXFLAGS). Filter on ` -c `: without it the count says 226 -O1, because the
# shared-library link line is g++ as linker driver carrying CXXFLAGS, and an
# -O on a link line is inert without LTO.
#
# Leaving the inheritance alone, but NOT because inheriting is better. An
# earlier version of this comment argued that a gate pinned below the shipping
# level tests code nobody installs, naming the aliasing and signed-overflow
# assumptions UBSan exists to catch. Measured, that argument does not hold:
#
#   UBSan signed overflow   reported identically at -O0, -O1, -O2 and -O3
#   strict aliasing         not reported at ANY level, by any sanitizer. The
#                           only instrument is -Wstrict-aliasing at compile
#                           time, and the line below used to claim it "also
#                           fires at -O0". It does not. What arms the warning
#                           is -fstrict-aliasing, the optimisation, which gcc
#                           enables at -O2 and above and DISABLES at -O0 and
#                           -O1. Measured on both shapes, at every level from
#                           1 to 3: silent at -O0 and -O1, fires from -O2 up,
#                           and armed at -O0 by naming -fstrict-aliasing
#                           explicitly. So the claim was right about the
#                           release build and wrong about the debug one, which
#                           is the build it was written to describe.
#   -Warray-bounds          -O0 silent, -O2 warns
#
# The level-dependent diagnostics are compiler *warnings*, and those already
# come from the release build, which compiles every TU at -O3 with -Werror. A
# sanitizer's own -O buys essentially nothing in detection, so on this evidence
# chron's choice - pin -O1 and get readable stack traces for free - is the
# better one. It is not changed here because the suite-wide question is not
# this Makefile's to settle; the measurement is recorded so whoever settles it
# is not relying on the argument above, which was wrong.

# It is what arms -Wstrict-aliasing, gcc disables it below -O2, and naming it
# also turns the ASSUMPTION on - a codegen change, not only a warning. So it
# belongs wherever it is codegen-neutral and nowhere else. Measured on all 76
# library TUs, comparing `objdump -d` text rather than object bytes, since
# debug info records the command line and makes every .o differ:
#
#   -O0, flag off vs on     0 of 76 objects differ
#   -O1, flag off vs on    30 of 76 differ

# transfer, and the 30 above is what inheriting it would have bought.

# Strict aliasing, named rather than inherited. Two flags doing two jobs:
#
#   -fstrict-aliasing     licenses the optimisation AND is what arms the

#   -Wstrict-aliasing=2   chooses what the warning diagnoses.
#
# Both were previously implicit, and each was implicit in a way that hid
# something.
#
# The LEVEL was 3, because -Wall implies 3 - it does not leave the level
# unset, which is what reading the flag list suggests. 3 is gcc's least
# aggressive setting. Measured here across five shapes at -O2, varying one
# thing at a time:
#
#                                              L0  L1  L2  L3
#   &visible object, direct deref               0   1   1   1
#   &visible object, via pointer variable       0   1   1   0
#   parameter, direct deref                     0   1   0   0
#   parameter, via pointer variable             0   1   0   0
#   local via void * -> int *                   0   0   0   0
#
# Two independent axes: taking the address of an object the compiler can see
# is what level 2 needs, and routing the cast through a separate pointer
# variable is what defeats level 3. So level 2 adds the second row over the 3
# that was in force, and costs nothing: all 76 library TUs compile clean at 2
# under -Werror, in both the release and debug configurations and with
# -DGCOMP_TEST_BUILD. Level 1 was measured too and is not adoptable - 7
# diagnostics in 5 files, every one a construct C17 sanctions (six are
# initial-member conversions, one is a trailing-array carve), and no true
# positive among them.
#
# The last row is the standing limit and bounds what this can claim: no level
# catches punning through a void *, which is the shape real code reaches for.
# This covers three of the five known shapes and is not aliasing coverage in
# general.
#
# The OPTIMISATION was on only by virtue of -O3, so `BUILD=debug` compiled at
# -O0 with the warning silent at every level - the debug build had no aliasing
# diagnostic at all, and looked identical to one that did. $(ALIASING_FFLAGS)
# names -fstrict-aliasing in the debug branch, and ONLY there, because naming it
# arms the assumption as well as the warning: measured codegen-neutral at -O0 and
# not at -O1. The note by OPT_CFLAGS has the figures.
#
# EXTRA_CFLAGS comes last and so can still displace the level: an explicit
# level beats -Wall's implicit 3 from either side, but a later explicit level
# displaces an earlier one, which makes EXTRA_CFLAGS=-Wstrict-aliasing=3 a
# silent disarming. check-aliasing is the reason that is not a silent one.

# demoted and `make test` prints thousands of lines. With them deleted the whole
# library, the examples, the benchmarks and the 112 test binaries compile clean,
# measured before removing it - so the escape now costs nothing and an unused
# static becomes an error at the moment it appears rather than a line nobody

# libver_gen.h is regenerated on every build and rewritten only when its content
# changes, so a variable given on the command line - make MAJOR_VERSION=2, or
# make BRANCH=-dev - takes effect. Keying the rule on the Makefile's timestamp
# alone left the previous token and version baked into the build, and nothing
# said so.

# EVERY rule that compiles a translation unit lists this header as an
# order-only prerequisite, and they have to stay that way. namespace.h
# includes libver.h, which includes libver_gen.h, so any source that reaches a
# public header needs it to exist before the compiler runs. Only the two
# release library rules had it. The result was that `make test-asan`,
# `make test-tsan` and `make fuzz-build` could not build a clean checkout at
# all: each stopped on
#
#     libver.h:45:10: fatal error: ghoti.io/compress/libver_gen.h
#
# after eleven lines of output, exit 2. Nobody hit it because nobody runs a
# sanitizer target as the first command in a fresh tree - a plain `make` first
# generates the header as a side effect of the release build, and from then on
# the file is simply there, so the missing prerequisite is invisible for the
# life of the checkout. It surfaced only in a scratch clone.
#
# The release paths were not affected and are worth distinguishing from the
# broken ones, so this is not read as a wider outage than it was: test
# executables take the static archive as a normal prerequisite, and
# test_helpers.cpp includes no compress header (the libver.h in its .d file is
# cutil's). The helper and release test rules are listed for uniformity, so
# that the rule set stops encoding a guess about which sources include what -
# adding one include to test_helpers.h would otherwise reintroduce this.

fuzz-replay: ## Replay the tracked corpus through every harness (no fuzzing)
# What this is for
# ================
#
# afl-fuzz mutates and writes; this only reads. Every file in fuzz/regression
# is fed to every harness, and any harness that does not exit cleanly fails the
# target. That makes it a regression check rather than a search: the inputs
# that once found something stay found, and a change that reintroduces one is
# caught in seconds rather than on whoever next runs a campaign.
#
# fuzz/corpus and fuzz/findings are gitignored working directories - they are
# afl-fuzz's, they grow, and they are not a record of anything. Running
# afl-fuzz against a corpus directory *adds to it*, so they cannot be the thing
# that is checked in. fuzz/regression is tracked, small, and never written to.
#
# Every file goes to every harness deliberately. Each one reads arbitrary bytes
# from stdin, so a deflate stream is a perfectly good input to the zstd decoder
# - a decoder must reject what is not its format as safely as it rejects a
# corrupt example of it. The harnesses are built with ASan and UBSan through
# the same FUZZ_SAN path afl-fuzz uses, so a memory error aborts.

# that removed nothing looks exactly like a clean that had nothing to remove.
# With SKIP_DEP_CHECK set for every goal, the check never fires at all, and a

# Strict-aliasing gate
####################################################################

check-aliasing: ## Fail if the strict-aliasing warning is no longer armed
# $(ALIASING_CFLAGS) is what detects these violations, and it lives in CFLAGS
# under -Werror - so a real violation fails the build and no sweep is needed.
# A disarmed warning fails nothing and looks exactly like a clean library.
# This compiles a planted violation with the library's OWN flags and fails if
# it is accepted.
#
# Deliberately $(CFLAGS) and not a copy: a control compiled with flags written
# out beside it proves those flags work, which is not the question.
#
# THE SHAPE OF THE CONTROL IS LOAD-BEARING, and the requirement is that a
# control for a gate at level N must be caught at N and MISSED at N+1. The
# grid is in the comment on ALIASING_CFLAGS. This control is the address of a
# visible object cast through a pointer variable - caught at 1 and 2, missed
# at 3 - so it certifies "2 or stricter" and fails if the level falls back to
# the 3 that -Wall implies, or to 0. The natural way to write a type pun,
# *(int32_t *)&obj, is diagnosed from level 1 up including 3, so a control
# spelled that way would pass with the gate switched off. Do not simplify it.
#
# The second compile is what stops this gate going vacuous on its own. It
# repeats the control with -Wstrict-aliasing=3 appended, which displaces the
# level (a later explicit level beats an earlier one - that is the same
# mechanism as the EXTRA_CFLAGS hazard, used here as an instrument), and
# requires it to be ACCEPTED. If a future gcc starts diagnosing this shape at
# 3, the control stops separating the levels and this gate would keep passing
# while asserting nothing about the level in force. Then it says so instead.
#
# Two failure causes this library has that chron's copy does not, both
# reported separately because they want different fixes:
#
#   -fstrict-aliasing [disabled]   the OPTIMISATION is off, so nothing arms
#                                  the warning at any level. That is what
#                                  -O0 and -O1 do, and why ALIASING_CFLAGS
#                                  names the flag.
#   level absent, query exit 0     the flag string is malformed. Not "unset"
#                                  and not clang - an empty -Q result has
#                                  three causes and exit status separates
#                                  them.
#
# clang accepts -Wstrict-aliasing=1 and =2 and implements neither, and rejects
# =3 outright, so `make CC=clang` reaches this gate with the aliasing flags on
# every compile line and no aliasing coverage behind them. That is a true
# failure and the gate reports it, naming the compiler rather than the flags.

# GCOMP_TEST_BUILD gate
####################################################################

check-test-build: ## Fail if the GCOMP_TEST_BUILD arms do not compile
# -DGCOMP_TEST_BUILD appears only in ASAN_CFLAGS and TSAN_CFLAGS, so `make
# test` never preprocesses the arms it selects: four files carry an
# `#ifdef GCOMP_TEST_BUILD` block, and thirteen more expand
# GCOMP_INTERNAL_API differently under it. Code inside an arm the
# preprocessor discards is not compiled, so -Werror has nothing to say about
# it - the release build is not lenient about those lines, it cannot see them.
#
# That is not hypothetical. A sign-compare added to an assertion inside one of
# these arms compiled clean under `make test` and failed `make test-asan`
# immediately, which is a slow and confusing way to find a one-line mistake:
# the sanitizer tree has to build first, and the failure arrives labelled as a
# sanitizer run. This is the same defect class as an unbuilt preprocessor
# branch anywhere else, and the fix is to compile the branch.
#
# A real compile to /dev/null, not -fsyntax-only, and that distinction was
# measured after -fsyntax-only gave a wrong answer elsewhere in this library.
# Warnings that need the middle end are simply absent under -fsyntax-only:
#
#                        -fsyntax-only   -c -o /dev/null
#   -Wsign-compare             1               1
#   -Wstrict-aliasing          1               1
#   -Wunused-function          0               1
#   -Warray-bounds             0               1
#
# -Warray-bounds is not in the -Wno-error= list, so it IS an error under
# -Werror - which means a syntax-only sweep could pass while the sanitizer
# build failed on exactly the kind of defect this gate exists to catch early.
# The cost of closing that is 11s against 1.4s for all 76 TUs, on a `make test`
# that takes minutes.
#
# It is still not a substitute for building the sanitizer trees and does not try
# to be. It answers "does this compile", which is now true rather than
# approximately true.
#
# TWO CONTROLS, EACH A PAIR. Both plant a defect inside a GCOMP_TEST_BUILD arm
# and require it REJECTED with the macro and ACCEPTED without it. The rejection
# proves the sweep's flags can see that class; the acceptance proves the
# premise, that the release build really is blind to these lines, so this gate
# covers something `make test` does not.
#
#   A  a sign-compare      the defect that prompted this gate. Visible to
#                          -fsyntax-only as well, so it says nothing about how
#                          the sweep compiles.
#   B  an array-bounds     invisible to -fsyntax-only, measured. This is the
#                          arm that certifies the sweep is a REAL compile: if
#                          anyone trades the 11s back for 1.4s by returning to
#                          -fsyntax-only, B stops firing and the gate says so.
#
# If a pair's two halves both fail, the sweep is not reading the macro. If both
# pass, that warning has left -Wextra and the control wants respelling rather
# than deleting.
#
# Scored by exit status per TU, not by grepping for "warning". A broken
# include path produces ERRORS, so a text search for warnings finds nothing
# and a sweep scored that way reports a clean library.

# Flags-stamp gate
####################################################################

# The flag stamps only work on the rules that name one. Nothing in make
# requires it: an object rule added without its stamp compiles with whatever
# flags are in force and is then never rebuilt when they change, which looks
# exactly like a correct incremental build. Three rules in this file went
# unstamped that way, and a fourth defect was subtler - four stamps recorded
# the variables their recipes were DERIVED from rather than the ones the
# recipes expand, so editing the literal text in LIB_CFLAGS left the recorded
# string byte-identical and rebuilt nothing.
#
# This is chron's check-stamps, ported, with three changes noted where they
# occur. It reads the makefile TEXT rather than asking make for its rule
# database, because a rule inside an `ifneq` does not exist in the database at
# all and that is exactly how one of the unstamped rules hid.
#
# The population is "every recipe that compiles a prerequisite", spelled as the
# -c $< that all eleven carry. Two things are checked per rule: that some flags
# stamp is a prerequisite, and that it is the stamp for the tree the object is
# built into - a rule copied between trees keeps the old stamp and then misses
# exactly the flag changes it was meant to catch. The tree's name is the prefix
# of both $(<TREE>_OBJ_DIR) and $(<TREE>_FLAGS_STAMP), so the pairing is
# derived rather than tabulated and a fifth tree needs no edit here.
#
# CHANGE 1, against chron's copy: a variable is accepted if ANY stamp the rule
# names records it, not just the first. The test executables here compile and
# link in one command, so they legitimately depend on two stamps - the tree's
# flags stamp for $(CXXFLAGS) and $(TEST_INCLUDE), and its link stamp for
# $(TESTFLAGS). Consulting only one reports the other's variables as
# unrecorded, which is how this arm read before the change.
#
# CHANGE 2: a -fsyntax-only invocation is counted as a PROBE, not as an
# unmodelled build rule. Nothing it produces can go stale, and both gates in
# TEST_GATES compile a control, so without this the unmodelled pin grows by one
# every time a gate is added and stops measuring what it is for.
#
# CHANGE 3: the head test accepts bare `cc` and `c++` as well as gcc/g++/clang.
# A recipe spelled that way with no -c $< marker was skipped by both arms
# silently. Nothing in this file is spelled that way; the control now carries
# one, so the hole cannot come back unnoticed.
#
# What it does NOT check: that a stamp's recipe records the flags in the same
# ORDER, or that the flags it records are the right ones. A rule compiling with
# some variable no stamp mentions is caught; a stamp recording a variable that
# is never used is not.

# Names the sweep skips, because the rule already lists the file as a normal
# prerequisite and mtime is the real check there. Pinned so the list cannot
# grow into an excuse.
#
# The three *COMPRESSLIBRARY names are the honest case to state: each expands
# to link flags AROUND a file that IS a prerequisite - for the release tree
# -Wl,--whole-archive $(APP_DIR)/$(STATIC_TARGET) -Wl,--no-whole-archive, for
# the sanitizer trees -L and -l naming the shared library. The file is covered;
# a change to the --whole-archive spelling itself would not relink, and that is
# a real if narrow gap rather than something this list makes safe.

# Compiler invocations outside the stamp model, pinned so the set cannot grow

# which is narrower than "every compile". The seven are:
#
#   3  shared-library links (release, ASan, TSan), which consume stamped
#      objects: a flag change moves the stamp, the objects rebuild and the
#      link follows from mtime.
#   3  compile-to-executable rules - two examples and the corpus generator -
#      each naming the static archive as a normal prerequisite, so the same
#      chain covers them.
#   1  the AFL harness link, in a tree with its own stamp on its objects.
#
# This is a pin, not a judgement. It fails when the number moves, so a new

# How many names the skip list holds. Pinned because a name added to it

# wrong cause.
STAMP_PREREQ_EXPECTED := 9

# -fsyntax-only invocations at the head of a recipe: check-aliasing's control
# and its vacuity compile. Pinned separately from the number above so that
# adding a gate and weakening the build cannot hide behind one figure.
#
# It read 4 until check-test-build's sweep became a real compile to /dev/null
# rather than -fsyntax-only, which moved its control compiles into a shell loop.
# The pin caught that, which is what it is for: a change in how a gate compiles
# should require someone to look. The two it lost are not unchecked - they are
# outside this model for the shell-loop reason below.
#
# Both of these are spelled `@if [!] $(CC) ...`, and the sweep could not see the
# negated form until the head normalisation learned to strip a leading `!`. That
# mattered beyond the count: a LINK rule spelled that way was skipped by both
# arms, appearing in neither LINKED nor UNMODELLED, which is the shape of
# blindness that reads as a clean result. The control carries a negated probe so
# it cannot come back.
#
# NOT counted, and why that is a limit rather than a rule: this model does not
# look past the head of a recipe, so the compiler invocations inside
# check-test-build's two shell loops - its four control compiles and its 76-TU
# sweep - are invisible to it. They are gate probes that write to /dev/null and
# produce nothing that can go stale, so nothing is lost here; the limit is that
# a real build step could hide the same way. Measured rather than assumed: every
# compiler name this file mentions away from a recipe head is a gate's own
# probe, a printf writing check-stamps' planted control, or a stamp recipe
# recording its flag string. No build rule hides a compiler in a shell recipe.
#
# Deliberately NOT done: teaching the probe test to recognise `-o /dev/null` as
# well as -fsyntax-only. No recipe in this file is spelled that way at a head
# position, so the branch would be unexercised, and an untested branch in a
# sweep is worse than a limit that is written down.
STAMP_PROBES_EXPECTED := 2

# What the planted control must produce. Four compile recipes, one of them
# wrapped; one with no stamp; four variables no stamp records, two of them past
# a line break; three link rules; two -fsyntax-only probes, one spelled with a
# bare compiler name; and two compiler invocations with no stamp at all.
#
# PREREQ is deliberately absent from this string. It counts the skip list,
# which is a constant of the sweep rather than something the control exercises,
# and while it was in here adding a name to that list failed the CONTROL first,
# reporting that the sweep had stopped reading rules correctly - which was not
# what had happened. The pin written for exactly that change could never fire.
# A second check on the same fact is not redundancy: it takes the first failure
# and reports the wrong cause.

# How many recipes consult $(SAN_REPORT_RE): the ASan and TSan quiet runners.
# Pinned because the check lives inside a shell branch, and simplifying that
# branch back to "exit status decides" is a one-line edit that no test would
# notice - the runners would go green on a reporting binary again.
SAN_SCAN_EXPECTED := 2

check-san-report: ## Fail if the quiet runners could not recognise a sanitizer report
# The quiet runners capture each binary's output and print it only when the run
# is judged a failure, so whatever the judgement misses is deleted rather than
# shown. That is not hypothetical here: a planted signed overflow once ran
# under test-asan-quiet, printed its diagnostic into the captured string, exited
# 0, and produced a green PASS row with the diagnostic discarded - the report
# existed and nothing kept it.
#
# Exit status alone cannot carry that judgement. -fno-sanitize-recover covers
# the checks it names and nothing else, a report from a child process does not
# set the parent's status, and the runtimes take their options from the
# environment, where a caller can turn halting off. So the runners also scan the
# output they already hold, which costs one grep per suite.
#
# That makes $(SAN_REPORT_RE) load-bearing, and a regex that matches nothing is
# indistinguishable from a clean run - the exact failure this gate exists to
# prevent, one level up. So: five report shapes must each be recognised, and two
# gtest summary lines must not be. The negatives are the two that come closest
# to the positives, since those are what a careless widening would catch.
#
# Counting matches rather than testing for non-empty output: a regex that
# matched every line would pass a "does it find anything" check.

# under it.  ASan finds a use-after-free only once the timing that produces it
# has actually happened, so a race that the test machine happens to lose
# leaves no trace.  TSan reports the race itself, from a single interleaving,
# whether or not that interleaving corrupted anything - which is the only way
# to have any confidence in a threaded path that passes because the scheduler
# has been kind.
#
# There are four such paths now: parallel encode for lz4 and Zstandard, and

# Unlike the ASan build, this one does *not* preload its runtime, and must not.
#
# -fsanitize=thread at link time puts libtsan.so.2 first in the executable's
# own NEEDED list, so the runtime already initialises before anything it has to
# intercept; the preload the ASan block needs would be redundant here.  It is
# also actively harmful.  With libtsan preloaded, every system() call in the
# test suite fails - the shell it spawns inherits the preload and dies, and
# system() returns 11 whatever it was asked to run.
#
# That is not a small blast radius.  Every oracle in this project shells out:
# python3 for zlib, gzip and deflate, the zstd CLI for Zstandard and for the
# seekable format.  A preloaded run reports all of them as "reference not
# installed".  The first full run of this target failed 135 tests for that
# reason and not one of them was a race.
#
# What caught it is worth keeping: those suites treat an absent oracle as a
# failure rather than a skip.  Had they skipped, this would have been a green
# ThreadSanitizer run in which nothing was ever compared against a reference.

####################################################################
# Flag stamps
####################################################################
# Each build tree carries the flag string it was built with. The stamp is
# rewritten only when that string differs -- written to a scratch file,
# compared, moved into place only on a difference -- so its mtime moves on a
# flag change and on nothing else. EVERY object rule above depends on the stamp
# for its own build tree, and that has to stay true of any rule added later,
# because a stamp is only worth its coverage.
#
# Three rules were left out when these were introduced: the release, ASan and
# TSan test_helpers.o rules, each an explicit rule sitting apart from the
# pattern rules that did get the stamp. So `make EXTRA_CXXFLAGS=-O2`
# recompiled every object except those three and linked the result, and
# nothing said so -- an object records nowhere make can see what flags built
# it, and a mixed build links and runs like any other.
#
# **A stamp must record the variables the recipes EXPAND, not the ones those
# derive from.** This is a separate failure from missing the prerequisite, it is
# invisible to a check that only asks whether a rule names a stamp, and it was
# live here in eleven distinct (stamp, variable) pairs. The library objects
# compile with $(LIB_CFLAGS) while this stamp recorded $(CFLAGS); every test
# object compiles with $(TEST_INCLUDE) while all three stamps recorded
# $(INCLUDE); and no stamp recorded $(CC), $(CXX) or $(AFL_CC) at all. Each of
# those is $(PARENT) plus literal text, so editing the literal -- changing
# -fvisibility=hidden, adding an -I -- leaves the recorded parent byte for byte
# identical and rebuilds nothing.
#
# Measured, with the control in the same run: changing -fvisibility=hidden to
# -fvisibility=default and adding an -I to TEST_INCLUDE, both as plain Makefile
# edits, recompiled 0 objects and moved no mtime, while a command-line
# EXTRA_CFLAGS change moved both in the same tree. `make CC=clang` recompiled 0
# objects and left DW_AT_producer reading "GNU C17 14.2.0" -- so a clang
# cross-check was comparing gcc against gcc, which matters because clang's UBSan
# reports what gcc's does not.
#
# The witness has to be a paired test with a control, because "it rebuilt" and
# "make found nothing to do" are the same empty output: build two objects,
# change a flag on the command line, then compare mtimes and the -O tokens gcc
# records in .debug_str. The stamped object moved and its recorded command line
# gained the new flag; the unstamped one did neither. Read the tokens as
# occurrences, not decisions -- both -O3 and -O2 appear on a command line where
# EXTRA_CFLAGS appends, and the last one is what the compiler used.
#
# This replaces listing `Makefile` as a prerequisite, which was too broad (a
# comment-only edit recompiled everything) and too narrow (a command-line
# override such as `make EXTRA_CFLAGS=-O2` changes no file's mtime and so was
# invisible).
#
# These rules sit at the end of the file for two reasons. A rule's target
# expands when make reads the line, so a stamp rule above its own OBJ_DIR
# definition has an empty target: not an error, just a rule that silently does
# not exist. And the first target in a makefile is the default goal, so a stamp
# rule above `all:` makes a bare `make` build the stamp and nothing else.
